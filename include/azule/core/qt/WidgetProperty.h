			///
			///	This class makes it possible to generically handle property editors without knowing the type of the property at runtime.
			///	This also makes it possible to not have the property system as a dependency of the core engine and its data.
			///	Derived widgets of this class will generally be constructed from the WidgetPropertyFactory with an unknown type at run time.
